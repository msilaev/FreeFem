# FreeFem
The FreeFem++ script "2DDistrNewCircDeepsSgenerated.edp" calculates the distribution of superconducting anomalous Green function in the spin-textured ferromagnet 
with complex geometry. The produced data is processed by the Matlab code "pltUsadelCircDeepNew.m" which needs also macros in ffmatlib.idp 
https://github.com/samplemaker/freefem_matlab_octave_plot and the blue-white-red colormap generator  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4058-bluewhitered
